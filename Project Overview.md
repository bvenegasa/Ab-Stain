# Project Title: AB-STAIN (Alcohol Behaviour - Study, Teach, Assess, Inform, Nurture)

## Problem Statement

Our aim is to combat alcohol abuse, particularly in lower-income, Spanish-speaking communities. We seek to provide resources and support through a smartphone application, AB-STAIN, which aids in tracking alcohol consumption and educates users about managing their alcohol intake. 

## Target Audience

Our primary audience includes Spanish-speaking individuals, especially those struggling with alcohol abuse and lacking access to necessary resources. However, the AB-STAIN app can be beneficial to anyone wishing to manage their alcohol consumption better, irrespective of their socio-economic background.

## Key Features

The AB-STAIN app will initially have two core features:

- Alcohol Intake Tracker: A user-friendly way to estimate and track alcohol consumption in grams. This will be a key part of both the intervention and the measurement of outcomes.
- Customized Educational Material: Actionable knowledge and resources, tailored according to the user's level of alcohol consumption.

## Volunteer Contributions

We are developing AB-STAIN as an open-source project to encourage community involvement and transparency. We seek contributions from volunteers with diverse expertise, specifically those from software development and healthcare backgrounds.

## Budget

We have an initial budget of $10,000 to cover the basic needs for software development, community management, and initial user outreach efforts.

## Tech Stack

Depending on the skills and preferences of our volunteer developers, we are open to using native technologies for Android (Kotlin) and iOS (Swift) or a cross-platform solution like React.

## Project Timeline

Our 12-month timeline consists of:

- Month 1: Project planning, volunteer recruitment, and preliminary UX design.
- Months 2-4: Core app development.
- Months 5-6: Beta release for user feedback and testing.
- Months 7-12: Iterative improvements and official app release.

## Measuring Success

Our primary indicators of success will be:

- Clinical Outcomes: These include the user's reported reduction in alcohol consumption.
- User Engagement and Knowledge: Measures of engagement such as user feedback and increased user knowledge about alcohol management.
- Project Expansion: Securing further interest and funding, which will enable us to scale our project.

## Future Vision

Following our initial success, we envision the AB-STAIN app scaling globally and becoming a universally accessible resource. We also anticipate adding more complex and meaningful features, such as tracking the development of alcohol-related diseases requiring hospitalization.

## Project Licensing and Open Source Access

The code for the AB-STAIN app will be fully open sourced under a chosen permissive license, with details to be decided at a later stage. Access to the app, however, will be initially limited to a select group of users for our validation study. This controlled access will help maintain the scientific and statistical rigor of our study.

## Relevance in Current Research

The efficacy of a similar closed-source app-based intervention in reducing hazardous alcohol consumption has been demonstrated by a recent Australian study (citation to be added). Our project, AB-STAIN, seeks to replicate this success within a Spanish-speaking demographic with an entirely independent and open-source application.

## Call to Action

We invite interested parties from diverse backgrounds, especially those with expertise in software development and healthcare, to join us in this important mission. Your contributions can make a significant difference in the lives of countless individuals.
