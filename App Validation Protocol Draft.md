# AB-STAIN Validation Study Protocol 

## Background 

The **AB-STAIN** application, standing for Alcohol Behaviour - Study, Teach, Assess, Inform, Nurture, is an open-source tool being built from scratch to aid in the reduction of alcohol consumption. It is primarily targeting Spanish-speaking users. This study seeks to validate the app's functionality and utility among a subset of this population.

Although there are closed-source app-based interventions proven effective in managing hazardous alcohol consumption[^1^], the need for targeted interventions in Spanish-speaking populations is significant. AB-STAIN seeks to fill this gap. Inspired by successful user experiences but not copying or translating any existing software, AB-STAIN is an entirely independent and open-source project.

## Open-source Nature

The software development of the AB-STAIN app will follow open-source principles to encourage community involvement and transparency. Specific details about software licensing will be decided and communicated at a later stage. This invites contributions from a diverse pool of developers and healthcare professionals and ensures the project's robustness and transparency.

## Aim

The primary aim of this study is to validate the AB-STAIN app's usability, functionality, and understandability in the Chilean population. It will include assessing the app's educational content, tracking capabilities, user interface, and user experience.

## Methodology

1. **Participants**: We plan to recruit 20 adults aged between 18-65 who report a varying degree of alcohol consumption. All participants should own a smartphone and be proficient in Spanish.

2. **Procedure**: Participants will be instructed to use the app for a period of one month. They will be guided on how to use the AB-STAIN app and will be encouraged to use it as they would in a real-world situation. 

3. **Data Collection**: Data will be collected through the app itself and through an end-of-study questionnaire. This will include the user's interaction with the educational material, alcohol consumption, reported usability issues, and suggestions for improvements.

4. **Data Analysis**: Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the data. Feedback will be analyzed qualitatively.

## Ethics and Confidentiality 

This study will adhere to the ethical guidelines of clinical research. All data collected will be anonymized and used only for the purposes of this study. 

## Study Timeline

The total duration of the study is projected to be three months: one month for participant recruitment, one month for the app use, and one month for data analysis and report writing. 

## Conclusion

The results of the study will inform the further development of the AB-STAIN app, paving the way for future efficacy studies to evaluate its impact on reducing alcohol consumption in our target population.
